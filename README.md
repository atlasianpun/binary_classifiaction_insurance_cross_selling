Insurance Cross-Validation and Model Comparison

Project Description

This project explores various machine learning models and techniques for analyzing insurance data. The primary objectives are to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), compare different machine learning models, and optimize model parameters using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques. The goal is to identify the best-performing models and configurations for predicting insurance-related outcomes.

Notebooks Overview

1. insurance-cross-eda.ipynb
This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the insurance dataset. It includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
Initial Insights: Deriving preliminary insights from the data, identifying patterns, and summarizing key statistics.
Key Sections:

Loading Data: Importing the insurance dataset and displaying the first few rows.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
Statistical Analysis: Computing summary statistics and exploring correlations between features.
Visualization: Plotting distributions, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize data characteristics and relationships.
2. insurance-cross-model-comparison.ipynb
This notebook compares various machine learning models on the insurance dataset. It includes:

Model Training: Training different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one based on the evaluation metrics.
Key Sections:

Data Preparation: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training multiple models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and others.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculating MAE, MSE, and R-squared for each model to assess performance.
Comparison and Visualization: Comparing models' performance using bar plots and identifying the best model.
3. sampling-hyperopt-insurance.ipynb
This notebook focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the Hyperopt library. It includes:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using Hyperopt to find the optimal hyperparameters for the models. This involves defining the search space, objective function, and running the optimization process.
Cross-Validation: Implementing cross-validation techniques to ensure robust and reliable model performance.
Best Model Selection: Identifying the model configuration with the best performance based on the cross-validation results.
Key Sections:

Defining the Search Space: Specifying the range of hyperparameters for optimization.
Objective Function: Creating an objective function to minimize the error metric.
Running Hyperopt: Executing the Hyperopt optimization process and logging the results.
Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter configurations.
Selecting the Best Model: Analyzing the optimization results to select the best hyperparameters and retrain the final model.
